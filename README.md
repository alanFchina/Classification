A brief introduction to how to use the code
------

The code folder contains the code and the data used for my article, and the data_description folder<br>
contains the introduction to the data. <br>
The file 'NB.py' is the model of semi-Naive Bayes classifier，and the file 'test.py'is the application<br> 
in my paper.<br>
You can just run "test.py" to watch the result of my experiment，and it will output the result and there <br>
are "**" before the error data. The environmnet of my code is py36. And before running the code, you mast <br>
have numpy moudle in your python<br> 
The error data is saved in the 'errordata.txt' file.
